	LastBatchVirtualizationTimeMaxWaitPeriod types.Duration `mapstructure:"LastBatchVirtualizationTimeMaxWaitPeriod"`
	// L1BlockTimestampMargin is the time difference (margin) that must exists between last L1 block and last L2 block in the sequence before

	// MaxTxSizeForL1 is the maximum size a single transaction can have. This field has
	// non-trivial consequences: larger transactions than 128KB are significantly harder and
	// more expensive to propagate; larger transactions also take more resources
	// to validate whether they fit into the pool or not.

	// GasOffset is the amount of gas to be added to the gas estimation in order
	// to provide an amount that is higher than the estimated one. This is used
	// to avoid the TX getting reverted in case something has changed in the network
	// state after the estimation which can cause the TX to require more gas to be
	// executed.

	// gas estimation: 1000
